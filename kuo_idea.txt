1. Title

Auditable Electronic Voting

2. Abstract

Voting has been made more accessible due to the introduction of electronic voting systems. 
Political elections have been utilizing electronic voting systems for several years. 
However, unlike with physical ballots, the Voting results from electronic voting systems are difficult to verify and often need to be audited. 
This problem was notably highlighted during the 2020 USA presidential elections.

3. Approach

Design a generic voting system that can produce different types of receipts (paper, audio, etc) that both the voters and auditors can easily verify.
The voting system should also check for invalid votes. This could include duplicates, deceased people, and ineligible voters.
