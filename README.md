# Project Proposals

## 1
# 1. Title
Sublease-Finder

# 2. Introduction to the problem statement
A lot of students want a lease for a very short duration when they do an internship. 

Apartments either donâ€™t give a lease for a short duration or they charge very high rent. The only viable option in such a scenario is for students to take a sublease from another student. 

This process is very messy because usually students contact other students on facebook or instagram, and there is no concrete proof about this agreement or transactions.

Our solution provides a platform for such agreements where there is a clear documentation of the agreed terms.

# 3. Abstract
We provide a platform for a student/person(seller), who wants to sublease their apartment, to upload their apartment details, along with cost, address and other details on our portal.

We also enable a student/person(buyer) looking for a sublease to search apartments based on their work address/cost, on our portal.

We show the buyer a list of apartments within a 25 mile radius that are being subleased. Then, the buyer can evaluate parameters of the apartment like the cost, facilities etc and make an informed decision.

# 4. Approach
We have 2 types of views for our application.

The first view is for the student/person who wants to sublease their apartment. They will submit their apartment details, along with cost, address and any other other details on our portal.

The second view is a search page for the student/person looking for a sublease.They will have to enter their desired address/work address. The algorithm will return a list of apartments within a 25 mile radius.

The buyer will then choose an apartment, choose their lease period and complete the process with the seller.

# 5. Persona(s)
This solution is especially designed for students who do internships in other cities of the US, which is a very common occurrence.
