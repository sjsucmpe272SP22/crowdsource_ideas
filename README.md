# Project Idea

## Title: Crowdsource Ideas

## Abstract:

## Approach:

For this project, we will be developing a web application to host an interactive, online community for crowdsourcing ideas. 

The web application will be built on a full MERN stack. 
- The data will be stored in MongoDB. 
- The data will be transfered through the application via Express/Node backend channels. 
- Users will interact with a UI built with a React/Node front end.

## Personas:

# Design

1) understand and research users and personas for your application well

2) create an empathy map for the users

3) Create AS-IS and To-Be scenarios

4) Prioritize the work and create hills/sub-hills that capture the theme of the problem you are going to solve.

5) break down into user stories and git issues to implement
